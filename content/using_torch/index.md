title: using torch

Once you've learned [the basics](/getting_started), you're ready to dive into applied examples. The list of examples keeps growing as the ecosystem evolves. What area are you interested in?

-   [Image recognition](#imag)
-   [Tabular data](#tab)
-   [Time series forecasting](#ts)

## Image recognition {#tab}

-   [Bird classification](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-10-19-torch-image-classification/) is a multi-class classification task. In addition to being a blueprint for doing classification with torch, this introductory example shows how to load data, make use of pre-trained models, and benefit from learning rate schedulers.

-   [Brain image segmentation](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-11-30-torch-brain-segmentation/) builds a U-Net from scratch. This intermediate-level example is a great introduction to building your own modules, as well as custom datasets that perform data preprocessing and data augmentation for computer vision.

## Tabular data {#tab}

-   [Labeling poisonous mushrooms](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-11-03-torch-tabular/) is a first introduction to handling a mix of numerical and categorical data, using embedding modules for the latter. It also provides a blueprint for creating torch models from scratch.

## Time series forecasting {#ts}

-   [Convolutional LSTM for spatial forecasting](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-12-17-torch-convlstm/) is an intermediate-level example that shows how to build a convolutional LSTM from scratch.
