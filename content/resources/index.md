If you're new to `torch`, deep learning, or both, we recommend checking out our comprehensive book [Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R `torch`](https://skeydan.github.io/Deep-Learning-and-Scientific-Computing-with-R-torch/), available both online and in [print](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/9781003275923/deep-learning-scientific-computing-torch-sigrid-keydana) form from CRC Press. It covers the basics (tensors, autograd, modules...), then works through popular deep-learning applications such as image segmentation, regression on tabular data, sound classification, and time-series forecasting. (And there's more -- see below.)

Still on the topic on basics and neural networks, for more practice with `torch` , you might want to give our [`learnr` tutorials](https://github.com/mlverse/torch-learnr) a try.

Deep learning is not the only thing, however, you can do with `torch`. The aforementioned book, in its [third part](https://skeydan.github.io/Deep-Learning-and-Scientific-Computing-with-R-torch/other_overview.html), uses `torch` for least-squares solution via matrix decomposition, to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform, and for the purpose of wavelet analysis.

Finally, to stay on top of new developments and releases, follow the [Posit AI Blog](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/). There, you'll also find interesting case studies and exciting new contributions from the community.
