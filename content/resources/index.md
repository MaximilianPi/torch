## torch

To get more practice with `torch` , we recommend checking out our `learnr` tutorials in the [torch-learnr](https://github.com/mlverse/torch-learnr) repository.

To stay on top of new developments and releases, we recommend you follow the [Posit AI Blog](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/). There, you'll also find interesting case studies and exciting new contributions from the community.

## Deep learning

If you're new to deep learning overall, it's true that although we've tried to make the [getting started](/start/) section usable with and without prior knowledge, you'll probably want to learn more about the concepts behind it. Here are some suggestions:

-   A great start would be Grant Sanderson's (a.k.a. 3Blue1Brown's) [video series on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

-   Also in the video department, there is no shortage of excellent materials, ranging from Geoffrey Hinton's classic 2012 [Coursera class](PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9) to Stanford's in-depth lectures on deep learning for [computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk) and [NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rXD5-xhemo&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z).

-   If you prefer books -- and are not scared of a bit of math -- the classic opus on DL is Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville's [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). It's also very suited to on-demand lookup of specific topics.
