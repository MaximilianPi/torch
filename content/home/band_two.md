Learn torch basics, from tensors via automatic differentiation to neural network modules. Then, check out how torch is used in applied problems, spanning areas as different as time series forecasting, image recognition, and text or audio processing. Finally, we always welcome contributions, be they large or small, to the [torch ecosystem](/packages)!
