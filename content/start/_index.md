In this four-part tutorial, you'll learn all the basics about torch, all while playing with a neural network from the outset!

Right at the start, you'll build a neural network from scratch, using nothing but functionality inherent in torch's basic data structure: *tensors*. In the remaining three tutorials, you'll successively get rid of all low-level operations and let torch do all the hard work for you:

-   first, by letting it do automatic differentiation;

-   second, by using neural network modules, instead of bare tensors; and

-   third, by calling torch optimizers to update the model's weights.

Once you're done, you're more than ready to go on and explore some of the [applied examples](/using_torch)!
