luz:
  weight: 2
  desc: "luz is a higher level API for torch providing abstractions to allow for much less verbose training loops. Luz let's you take your Torch nn_module definition and fit it to a dataloader, while handling the boring parts like moving data between devices, updating the weights, showing progress bars and tracking metrics."
